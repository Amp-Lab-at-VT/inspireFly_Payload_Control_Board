## Current Status
Just Starting

## Project Overview
This project is about designing, manufacturing, and testing a payload control board for a 1U cubesat. The board will control a camera, display screen, and deployable boom. 

## Educational Value Added
This project will teach students about advanced power systems concepts, such as DC-DC converters, how electronics in space work, and how to get multiple microcontrollers working together.
Additionally, students will learn how to create circuit schematics and PCB board designs that are used to manufacture a product.

## Hardware Tasks
1. Finalize board schematic
2. Construct PCB
3. Populate PCB
4. Test PCB's functionality

## Software Tasks
1. Establish functionality between the camera and microcontroller
2. Establish functionality between the display screen and microcontroller
3. Have the microcontroller control the camera and display screen simultaneously, and take a picture of the display screen
4. Transfer the picture to a different microcontroller.

## Design Decisions
1. Using BroncoSpace PROVES kit as the base of the satellite. Need to conform to their system.
2. Using a Arduino for the microcontroller
3. Using the OV5642 Camera
4. Using the Adafruit OLED Breakout Board for the screen

## Design Misc

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

## BOM + Component Cost
To be determined
## Timeline
10/9/2023 Update Github
11/1/2023 Have a fully functioning software suite (breadboard setup)
11/1/2023 Have a fully functioning PCB design (electrical connections)
11/15/2023 Have the software running as expected on the PCB board
